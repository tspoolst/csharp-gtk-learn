Cross-platform and well-suited for Linux environments.
Install the GTK development package:

Simple to use and modern.
Install Avalonia templates:
dotnet new install Avalonia.Templates
c. MAUI (Experimental for Linux)
.NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) is Microsoft's cross-platform framework.
Limited support for Linux (experimental).


For Avalonia:
bash
dotnet new avalonia.app -n AvaloniaApp
cd AvaloniaApp


6. Optional: Install an IDE
For easier development, you can use an IDE like:

Visual Studio Code with C# extension
JetBrains Rider (commercial)
